Utilizing the skills we learned in class today, your task is to develop a simple "To-Do" application.


Assignment Objectives:

Please ensure that your application includes the following features:

1. Form Creation: Develop a form to add a to-do item. Each to-do item should include a title and a description.

2. Displaying To-Do Items: Render each to-do item on the webpage.

3. Interactive To-Do Items: Add
a click event listener to each to-do item. When clicked, the item
should either be marked as done by modifying its style or be removed
from the list entirely.


Extra Challenge:


1. Persistent Storage: Use
LocalStorage to save the state of the to-do list, so that even if the
user refreshes the page or closes the browser, their to-dos are still
available when they return.

2. Filtering Options: Allow for the filtering of to-do items based on their status: all, active, or completed.

3. Due Dates: Add a due date for each to-do item and display overdue items in a different style.

4. Sorting: Implement functionality to sort the to-do list by different criteria such as creation date, due date, or alphabetical order.

5. Categories/Tags: Allow
the user to add categories or tags to their to-do items. For example,
they might have categories like "Work", "Groceries", or "Personal".

6. Priority Levels: Let users set priority levels for each to-do, and style the high-priority tasks to make them stand out.

7. Notifications: Use the Notification API to remind the user of their tasks when they are due.


Remember,
these are just options for extending the application. They are not
required and some of them are more challenging than others. It's best to
ensure that the basic functionality is solid before moving on to these
extra features.


Remember, coding is an exercise in
problem-solving, and there's no one way to approach these tasks. I
encourage you to be creative, have fun, and reach out if you're stuck or
have any questions.
